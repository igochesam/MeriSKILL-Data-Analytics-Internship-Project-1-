# MeriSKILL Data Analytics Internship (Project 1)
Sales Data Analysis

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to analyse the given sales data to identify trends, top-selling products, and revenue metrics for business decision-making. This project contains a large sales dataset from which I have extracted valuable insights. It involved exploring sales trends over time, identifying the best-selling products, calculating revenue metrics such as total sales and profit margins, and creating visualizations to effectively present my findings. This project served to test my ability to manipulate and derive insights from large datasets, enabling me to make data-driven recommendations for optimizing sales strategies.

## Objective of the Analysis

The objective of this analysis is to identify trends, top-selling products, and revenue metrics from the given dataset and report findings using the appropriate media such as graphs and charts.

## Data Exploration

I started by trying to clean the data. I first of all checked for missing values in the dataset and fortunately, there were no missing values.
